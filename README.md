## 🚀 Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) Course Learnings 📚
## Day-1 Learning Outcomes

Welcome to this repository documenting my journey through the Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) professional course, offered by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC) - Hyderabad, and supported by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India. This README captures key insights, concepts, and practical skills acquired from the course modules, with a focus on integrating security into software development processes. The course uses a Course Management System (CMS) as a practical example to illustrate secure practices, emphasizing proactive threat mitigation and compliance.

Through this course, I explored foundational and advanced topics in secure software engineering, enhancing my ability to design, implement, and maintain robust applications. Below, I outline the major learnings structured by lessons and topics.

## 🔒 Lesson 1: Introduction to SDLC Phases 🛡️

This introductory lesson provided an overview of the traditional Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) phases, setting the stage for incorporating security elements.
- 🔹 Gained understanding of core SDLC stages, including planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.
- 🔹 Learned how security must be embedded from the outset to prevent vulnerabilities, using visual aids like process diagrams for clarity.
- 🔹 Explored the evolution from standard SDLC to Secure SDLC (SSDLC), highlighting the need for threat modeling and risk assessment.

## 📘 Lesson 2: Introduction to Secure Software Development Lifecycle 📊

Building on Lesson 1, this module delved into the secure variant of SDLC, using the Course Management System (CMS) as a case study for practical application.
- 🔹 Understood the project scope of a CMS, involving user roles like instructors, admins, and registrants, with features such as login, course registration, and management.
- 🔹 Acquired knowledge on integrating security controls across lifecycle phases to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- 🔹 Explored real-world examples of secure development, emphasizing the importance of a structured approach to minimize risks in web-based applications.

## 🛡️ Lesson 3: Secure Software Requirements 🔑

This comprehensive lesson focused on defining and managing security requirements, forming the backbone of secure software design. It included multiple topics and a hands-on lab.
- 🔹 Mastered the process of capturing security requirements using frameworks like OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) version 4.0.
- 🔹 Developed skills in reviewing ASVS documents to select appropriate security categories, with 286 requirements across 14 chapters and 69 subchapters.
- 🔹 Learned to create a security requirements checklist, particularly for authentication mechanisms in a CMS login page.

### 📊 Topic 1: Define Security Requirements 📝

- 🔹 Applied OWASP ASVS to identify assurance levels and controls for web applications, focusing on authentication and cryptography.
- 🔹 Prepared checklists for secure login implementations, such as verifying passwords are at least 12 characters long.
- 🔹 Understood problem statements involving username-password authentication and corresponding security verifications.

### 🔐 Topic 2: Data Classification and Privacy Requirements 🛡️
